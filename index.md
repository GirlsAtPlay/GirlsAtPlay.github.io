This site will be a showcase for the projects that my daughters (Zoe, Abby, and
Mary Frances) and I work on.

## A Note on Tech

My other sites are powered by [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), backed by a 
[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) database.

* [Fauxcabulary](http://www.fauxcabulary.org/) - my pun-a-day blog.
* [Codetopia, LLC](http://www.codetopia.com/) - my company site.
* [GrowYourKnow](http://www.growyourknow.com/) - my "I'll get to it eventually" site.

But, this website is created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), using the 
[JekyllBootstrap theme](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), and hosted on 
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Here are some [other Jekyll websites](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites).

## Thanks

Thanks for stopping by. Expect more content here soonish.
